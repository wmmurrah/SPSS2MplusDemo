These files contain data and code discussed on my website (www.williammurrah.com) in the post entitled "Preparing and SPSS data file for Mplus".

Data
------

The data used is a subset of the STAR public access data file
which is available with the AER package for $R$.
Christian Kleiber and Achim Zeileis (2008). Applied Econometrics with $R$. New
York: Springer-Verlag. ISBN 978-0-387-77316-2. 
URL http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER

The create.star.R file contains $R$ code to create a data file similar to the one used in this demontration.

Data files include a raw data file (star.csv), an SPSS file (star.sav) and a tab delimited file (star.dat), the latter of which can be used by Mplus.

Code
----

The SPSS syntax file (star.sps) contains syntax for the steps covered in this demonstration. An Mplus input file (starMplus.inp) and resulting output file (starMplus.out) are included for reference.
